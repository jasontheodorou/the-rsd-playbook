/* The interactive read of part2.svg for the Closing page. Copy deliberately
   picks up this page's own language — "builds knowledge through doing",
   "experience the process themselves", "embedded into the culture" — so the
   four moments expand on what the prose already says rather than restating it.

   Colours are deepened from the artwork's own fills: the drawing's pale
   tints are legible as shapes but too faint for a 2px rule or a hairline
   wire on the cream page ground. */
